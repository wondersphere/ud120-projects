# As you may now see, having imbalanced classes like we have in the Enron dataset (many more non-POIs than POIs)
# introduces some special challenges, namely that you can just guess the more common class label for every point,
# not a very insightful strategy, and still get pretty good accuracy!
# Precision and recall can help illuminate your performance better. Use the precision_score and recall_score
# available in sklearn.metrics to compute those quantities.
# What's the precision?

# Answer: POI precision = 0

# What's the recall?
# (Note: you may see a message like UserWarning: The precision and recall are equal to zero for some labels. Just
# like the message says, there can be problems in computing other metrics (like the F1 score) when precision and/or
# recall are zero, and it wants to warn you when that happens.)
# Obviously this isn't a very optimized machine learning strategy (we havenâ€™t tried any algorithms besides the
# decision tree, or tuned any parameters, or done any feature selection), and now seeing the precision and recall
# should make that much more apparent than the accuracy did.
# Answer: POI recall = 0
